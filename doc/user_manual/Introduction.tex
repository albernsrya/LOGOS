\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Industry Equipment Reliability (ER) and Asset Management (AM) Programs are essential elements that
help ensure the safe and economical operation of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). The effectiveness of
these programs is addressed in several industry developed and regulatory programs. However, these
programs have proven to be labor intensive and expensive. There is an opportunity to significantly
enhance the collection, analysis, and use of this information to provide more cost-effective plant
operation. LOGOS is providing computational capabilities to optimize plant resources such as
maintenance optimization (ER application) and optimal component replacement schedule (AM application)
by using state-of-the-art discrete optimization methods.

LOGOS is a software package and a RAVEN~\cite{RAVEN,RAVENtheoryMan} plugin which
contains a set of discrete optimization models that can be
employed for capital budgeting optimization problems, and LOGOS integrates economic and reliability
risk in a single analysis framework. More specifically,  Provided Systems, Structures and Components
(SSCs) health (e.g., failure rate or failure probability), OM costs, replacement costs, cost
associated to component failure and budget constraints, LOGOS provides the optimal set of projects
(e.g., SSC replacement) that maximizes profit and satisfies the provided requirements. Input data
listed above can be either deterministic or stochastic in nature, i.e., they can be point values
or probability distribution functions. In the latter case, several scenarios are generated by
sampling the provided distributions.

The developed models are based on different versions of the knapsack optimization algorithms.
Two main classes of optimization models have been initially developed: deterministic and stochastic.
Stochastic optimization models evolve deterministic models by explicitly considering data
uncertainties (associated to constraints or item cost and reward).

These models can be employed as stand-alone models or interfaced with the INL developed RAVEN code
to propagate data uncertainties and analyze the generated data (i.e., sensitivity analysis).

\subsection{Acquiring and Installing LOGOS}
LOGOS is supported on three separate computing platforms: Linux, OSX (Apple Macintosh), and Microsoft
Windows. Currently, LOGOS is downloadable from LOGOS GitLab repository:
\url{https://hpcgitlab.hpc.inl.gov/RAVEN_PLUGINS/LOGOS.git}. New users should contact LOGOS developers to
get start with LOGOS. This typically involves the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Download LOGOS}
    \\ You can download the source code of RAVEN from \url{https://hpcgitlab.hpc.inl.gov/RAVEN_PLUGINS/LOGOS.git}.
  \item \textit{Install LOGOS dependencies}
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	path/to/LOGOS/build.sh
	\end{lstlisting}
  \item \textit{Run LOGOS}
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	./run_tests
	\end{lstlisting}
  	Alternatively, the \texttt{logos} script
    contained in the folder ``\texttt{LOGOS}'' can be directly used:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
path/to/LOGOS/logos -i <inputFile.xml> -o <outputFile.csv>
\end{lstlisting}
	\item \textit{Used as RAVEN Plugin}, RAVEN need to be installed
		\\ Instructions are available from \url{https://github.com/idaholab/raven/wiki}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Manual Formats}
In order to highlight some parts of the user manual having a particular meaning
(input structure, examples, terminal commands, etc.), specific formats have been used.
This section provides the formats with a specific meaning:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Python Coding:}}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
class AClass():
  def aMethodImplementation(self):
    pass
\end{lstlisting}
\item \textbf{\textit{LOGOS XML input example:}}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={anAttribute}]
<MainXMLBlock>
  ...
  <aXMLnode anAttribute='aValue'>
     <aSubNode>body</aSubNode>
  </aXMLnode>
  <!-- This is  commented block -->
  ...
</MainXMLBlock>
\end{lstlisting}
\item \textbf{\textit{Bash Commands:}}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cd path/to/LOGOS/
./build.sh
cd ../../
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Components of LOGOS}
In LOGOS, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format is used to create the input file. For more
information about XML, please click on the link:
\href{https://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp}{\textbf{XML tutorial}}.
%
\\The main input blocks are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{Logos}: The root node containing the
  entire input, all of
  the following blocks fit inside the \emph{Logos} block.
  %
  \item \xmlNode{Settings}: Specifies the calculation settings, i.e. options for
	optimization solvers, options for constraints, and working directory.
  %
  \item \xmlNode{Sets}: Specifies a collection of data, possibly including
	numeric data (e.g. real or integer values) as well as symbolic data (e.g. strings)
	that is typically used to specify the valid indices for an indexed components.
	\nb numeric data provided in the \xmlNode{Sets} would be treated as strings.
  %
	\item \xmlNode{Parameters}: Specifies a collection of parameters, a parameter
	is a numerical value that is used to formulate constraints and objectives in a
	optimization model. It can denote a single value, an array of values or a multi-dimensional
	array of values.
	%
	\item \xmlNode{Uncertainties}: Specifies a collection of scenarios, a scenario is a
	numerical value that is used to simulate the variation of a parameter. It should have
	the same format as the parameter.
	%
	%
	\item \xmlNode{ExternalConstraints}: Specifies a collection of external constraints, a
	external constraint is a Python function that is used to add additional constraint to
	current optimization problem.
	%
\end{itemize}

Each of these components are explained in dedicated sections of the user manual.
