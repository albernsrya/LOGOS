\section{Software Design}
\subsection{Introduction}
The mission is to provide a framework/container of capabilities for 
engineers and scientists to perform probability risk assessment, risk-informed asset management and plant health management. 
NuSAR was conceived with two major objectives: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item  to be as easy and straightforward to use by scientists and engineers as possible. 
  \item to allow its expansion in a straightforward manner, providing clear and modular APIs  to developers.
\end{itemize}
The general input syntax/calculation workflow can be found in the RAVEN user manual ~\cite{RAVENuserManual}.
