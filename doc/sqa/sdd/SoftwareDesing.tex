\section{Software Design}
\subsection{Introduction}
The mission is to provide a framework/container of capabilities for
engineers and scientists to perform probability risk assessment,
risk-informed asset management and plant health management.
NuSAR was conceived with two major objectives:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  to be as easy and straightforward to use by scientists and engineers as possible.
  \item to allow its expansion in a straightforward manner, providing clear and modular APIs  to developers.
\end{itemize}

The \textit{\textbf{LOGOS}} plug-in has been coded using the language \emph{Python}. The \emph{Python}
code can be used as an ``external mode'' in RAVEN (for installation and usage instructions, see~\cite{RAVENuserManual}).
The input of  \textit{\textbf{LOGOS}} is an XML file, which can be read and executed by the plug-in and RAVEN.
